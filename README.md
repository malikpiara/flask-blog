# Moon(static)

ðŸŒ™ Static website generator built for my personal blog.

## Get Started

Clone the repository into your own computer. Make sure you have a recent version of Python installed. Create a new virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`.

After creating a your new virtual environment use the terminal to activate it with the command `source venv/bin/activate`.

Run the website on your computer with `python app.py`. Use the arguement `build` to freeze the app and turn it into static files: `python app.py build`.
