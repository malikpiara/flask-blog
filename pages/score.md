title: It's hard to score when we don't have a goal
date: 2021-03-11

Sometimes we take on new projects and say 'yes' to opportunities to later realise we should have said 'no'. This happens frequently when we're young. We don't often have a clear sense of purpose or direction. And there is always something new.

When opportunities come knocking on our door, we don't know when to say 'yes' and when to say 'no'. We float towards different directions because we're living on autopilot.

Without a purpose, we might one day realise, we're no closer to achieving what we really want in life than we were 10 years ago. We might, inadvertently, end up in places where we're doing something we don't want to be doing. We might choose the wrong city to live in. Pick the wrong partner. Pursue the wrong career. — Our happiness is at stake.

It doesn't have to be this way. Every decision we make about how we spend our time counts. Every day, we have a chance to make little choices that can steer our life towards a better future. We can have more control of what lies ahead if today, we're brave enough to make a decision about what's important for us. — And about what is not.
