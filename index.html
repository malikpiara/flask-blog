<h1 class="title">
    <a href="follow-through.html">Follow through</a>
</h1>
<p>Integrity is doing what we say we will do. Even when it hurts us. Especially when it hurts us. This is the hardest principle to follow in my book as it requires a sharp and tuned degree of consistency and self-awareness. This takes time to grow.</p>
<p>a. Do not make commitments you know you can‚Äôt uphold. When we fail to deliver on a promise, we cause other people to have a worse impression of us. Because we use our past actions as information about who we are, failing to deliver on what we set out to do, often damages our own sense of worth. This is also true for when we set personal goals or intentions we fail to work towards. Every tiny action matters.</p>
<p>b. Avoid relying on people who didn‚Äôt follow through in the past. We‚Äôre not always able to pick who we work with. Having that in mind, we can choose the people we rely on. These are the people we make an active decision to build personal and professional projects with. Because the stakes are higher, we should be especially cautious and not let our hope and dreams blind us. By picking a partner we know to lack integrity, we are corrupting our own sense of virtue and there will always be a price to pay later on.</p>
<p>Better to disappoint early on and to be less ambitious about what we can do than to break our reputation and self-esteem. We deserve to go to bed every night knowing we can trust ourselves. Knowing we can be relied on.</p>
<br><hr><br>



<h1 class="title">
    <a href="be-kind.html">Be kind</a>
</h1>
<p>It‚Äôs easy to forget that every single person you interact with, is going through something you are not aware of. Learn to be compassionate and always remember to be kind. To you and to others.</p>
<br><hr><br>



<h1 class="title">
    <a href="today.html">Copy the work of others</a>
</h1>
<p>It‚Äôs easy to overlook the present, when we are too focused on anticipating what‚Äôs coming. On chasing goals. Painting dreams.</p>
<p>It can be important to stop and realise that, what we use to define ‚Äúthese days‚Äù, will soon define ‚Äúthe good old days‚Äù. ‚Äî The place we live in. Our circle of friends. What we look forward to, when we wake up. Or when we go to bed. Everything must change, because that‚Äôs what time is made of. Change.</p>
<p>Looking back, we become enamoured with the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù. But they won‚Äôt happen again. And neither will today.</p>
<p>What are you grateful for today? And how would you go about showing someone that you care for them?</p>
<br><hr><br>



<h1 class="title">
    <a href="noteworthy.html">Becoming noteworthy</a>
</h1>
<p>Even though we are all different on paper, in reality, most of us act in conformity. ‚Äî We wear the same shoes, build websites that look the same and have opinions that are not worth to bat an eyelash for.</p>
<p>As Humans, we are great at identifying patterns. We are also often drawn to what is the most familiar without realising.</p>
<p>The problem with familiar, is that familiar, is also boring. Noteworthy subjects stand out because they do something dissonant. Something worth talking about. Something worth spreading. Noteworthy people move the needle.</p>
<p>Because we are all different at the core, we all have an innate ability to produce noteworthy products and ideas. Learning to amplify what makes us unique, can be a way to do so.</p>
<p>Can you stop to think about key traits that define you?</p>
<p>What do people say about you when you‚Äôre not in the room?</p>
<p>What are some things that excite you, that normally make most people fall asleep?</p>
<p>Be bold and you might just be rewarded.</p>

    <a href="growing.html">On feeling like giving up</a>
</h1>
<p>Next time you feel like giving up, realise that, this might be a good indication that you are out of your comfort zone. Do not let that stop you from moving.</p>
<p>Fight or flight mechanisms are a necessary part of growth. Acknowledging that you are overwhelmed. Acknowledging that you want to run or hide, is already half the battle.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath and call someone who can listen. You‚Äôll be stronger tomorrow.</p>
<br><hr><br>



<h1 class="title">
    <a href="pessimism.html">On pessimism</a>
</h1>
<p>Optimism is the tragedy of the 21st century. Despite what the popular opinion may be, I have found that, adopting it as frame of mind, can often promote short-sightedness and wishful-thinking. When life doesn‚Äôt go as planned, we suffer unproportionally. ‚Äî This is especially true when the stakes are high. A pessimistic approach towards global warming is often also the most realistic.</p>
<p>Unlike optimism, a pessimist outlook provides us with information we can use to grow. This makes it more useful to have as a frame of mind. Having an awareness about what might go wrong, can make you better equipped to deal with whatever life might throw at you.</p>
<p>a. Imagine the worst case scenario. This will enable you to see situations from a higher level and help you plan for a future you cannot control.</p>
<p>By contemplating bad outcomes, you can come up with plans to prevent or deal with them. Imagining a work presentation going wrong, will get you to put more effort into making sure it doesn‚Äôt. Anticipating a crisis, will keep you on your toes and make you more long-term oriented.</p>
<p>b. Do not spend time or energy with things you cannot control. Pessimism can be useful when it enables you to plan ahead and take action. We cannot control what happens to us, but we can control how we choose to deal with what happens. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm advocating.</p>
<p>c. Realise that, whatever you may have today can be taken away tomorrow. Let this be a reminder that keeps you humble and grateful.</p>

    <a href="copy.html">Copy the work of others</a>
</h1>
<p>Many people celebrate the work of Pablo Picasso, but often overlook the process that contributed to make him the genius we all know and appreciate today.</p>
<p>At the age of 16, Picasso was living in Madrid. He spent long periods of time at the Prado museum, admiring and copying the works of great artists that came before him, like Goya and Vel√°squez. His story is akin to the ones told about Beethoven and Benjamin Franklin. The latter transcribed passages of his favourite writers and often tried to emulate their style, in order to improve his own.</p>
<p>The process of copying and reflecting on the work and process of people with more experience than you, enables you to get acquainted with patterns you wouldn't have. And at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Whenever you want to learn a new skill or improve on existing ones, realise that there is, or has been someone out there with more experience than you. With whom you can learn from. There is no shame in copying the work of others when your goal is to learn.</p>
<p>a. Do not try to be original. Originality comes from experience and materializes naturally when you have enough building blocks.</p>
<p>My past experience shows me that jumping and attempting to create something of your own before having the tools to do so, often equates with a lack of self-knowledge. In order to chop down a tree, you must first sharpen the axe.</p>
<p>With enough experience and vocabulary, you can go on to create your own work and improve on the work of others.</p>
<p>In a nutshell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a piece of work you want to emulate.</li>
<li>Try to copy the piece in the best fashion you deem possible.</li>
<li>While doing so, close your eyes and try to visualize each step of the process.</li>
</ol>
